## Project Overview

**Event Echo** is a memory-sharing map app for real-world events.  
After attending an event (concert, festival, lecture, etc.), users can create an **event room** (if one doesn‚Äôt already exist) and post **one photo and one short reflection** about their experience.  
Other attendees can join the same event room and add their own ‚Äúecho‚Äù ‚Äî a photo and thought ‚Äî building a **community-generated timeline and memory wall** for that event.

Over time, each event‚Äôs location becomes a **shared memory space**, where users can relive collective experiences and see different perspectives.  

Additionally, users can **upvote or downvote** contributions, with the best ones being **pinned** to the top and earning contributor points.

## App Flow

1. Open the app and view a **map** with pins for nearby or upcoming events.  
2. Tap a pin to view photos and reflections shared by other attendees.  
3. Upload your own ‚Äúecho‚Äù (one photo + one short thought) after attending.  
4. Explore the **memory wall** ‚Äî a grid or timeline view of user contributions.  

Each location evolves into a living archive of shared memories.

## Target Users & Problem Being Solved

**Target Users:**
- University students (campus events, lectures, club activities)  
- Music festival, conference, movie, play, or sports attendees  
- Event hosts looking for community feedback and engagement  

**Problems Solved:**
- After events, photos and reflections are scattered across personal galleries and social feeds.  
- There‚Äôs no single place to collectively share experiences tied to a specific **time and location**.  
- Event organizers lack an easy way to gather public sentiment or feedback.

Event Echo solves these by providing a **shared, location-tied memory wall**.

## Planned Features

### MVP Features
- **Event Map:** Interactive map showing pins for all past and upcoming events (Google Maps API).  
- **Event Creation:** Users can create or join an event by selecting a location and time.  
- **Memory Upload:** Each user can upload one photo and one reflection per event.  
- **Memory Wall:** Scrollable timeline/grid of all uploaded memories.  
- **Authentication:** Basic login/signup for user accounts.

- **Social Features:** Upvotes/downvotes, best contributor badge, event follows, notifications for nearby or new events.  
- **AR Timeline:** Optional AR view showing memories in physical space.  
- **Weather Integration:** Display event weather data for context.
